# Apocha
Receipt validation framework for iOS and macOS written in Swift

Use this framework with macOS to validate wether your App was officially bought from the Mac AppStore. Also called local receipt validation. It may also be used to validate In-App-Purchases under macOS, iOS and tvOS.

It's based on the Apple Security Frameworks so there is no need to include OpenSSL into your App.
